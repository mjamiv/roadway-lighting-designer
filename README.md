## Key Features

### Roadway Design Inputs
- Define and edit road segments (e.g., straight and curved) with properties such as length, grade, curvature radius, and direction.
- Customize road characteristics, including width, number of lanes, classification (e.g., freeway, arterial, local street), and cross-slope (crown).

### Pole Configuration
- Set specific pole spacing and mounting height.
- Choose between different layout arrangements: single side, staggered, and opposite.
- Tailor lighting arm lengths for specific designs.

### Luminaire Specifications
- Adjust parameters like lumen output, beam angle, and maintenance factors to align with your lighting needs.

### Interactive 3D Visualization
- Rotate, zoom, and pan to visualize a 3D lighting simulation.
- Enable visual elements like illuminance mesh, light poles, light cones, and grid lines.

### Auto-Optimization and Compliance
- Use the "Auto-Optimize" feature for dynamic lighting design configurations that meet industry standards.
- Check compliance with IES RP-8 lighting standards by evaluating metrics such as illuminance levels and uniformity.

### Metrics and Statistics
- Display detailed statistics: total road length, illuminance, uniformity ratios, and pole counts.
- Evaluate lighting intensity and verify compliance with specific roadway classifications.

### Accessibility
- User-friendly dropdowns and sliders for each configuration parameter.
- Seamless alignment and animations for better user experience.
